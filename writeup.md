## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

[According to my OpenAi labled date, The most common sentiment observed is negative.]

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[I believe the labels are reliable to a certain extent because it is not completely accurate as a whole. That being said, there were a few reviews that misinterpreted the comments made from the customers. For an example, a customer stated to give VITA COCO a 5 star but none for Zico and the result was "positive". There are inconsistencies within the prompts and OpenAi deficiency.]

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[What I would recommend in order to improve customer satisfaction is stop extracting it from unriped immature coconuts because that leads to bad after taste. Another recommendation to stop utilziing plastic to store the coconut water due to bad taste stated by customers. The company can improve its product by storing it in glass bottles or in tetra form and to use fresh coconuts and not old ones.]
